It also gives an overview of the steps required for implementing an SMSS. Key Points: A sample registration system (SRS) uses a similar sampling survey concept but establishes continuous collection of population, fertility and mortality data from small geographic areas, carefully selected to generate estimates that are representative at a desired domain such as national, provincial or district level. An SRS can provide data that’s more complete than the data from civil registration and health systems and more timely than data from largescale household surveys. An SRS can be designed to catalyze the rapid scale-up of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics in high mortality countries. The availability of continuous information on mortality and its distribution in a country is necessary for effective decision-making in health program planning and resource allocation. It is also required for the monitoring of the effectiveness of health programs in preventing premature deaths. However, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which bear the highest burden of preventable premature deaths, suffer a crucial lack of timely data on mortality and causes of death. Thus, they are unable to adequately make health planning decisions based on local and empirical mortality information. Government data systems such as the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) and the routine health information system (RHIS) offer promising solutions, but their current mortality deficiencies are enormous and structural, and it will take decades to address them. CRVS suffers severe coverage and event registration incompleteness. RHIS captures only facility users, and deaths are not completely recorded and reported or always certified with cause of death. A feature of these systems, which is also their main challenge, is their exhaustivity mandate, that is their legal and ethical requirement to cover the entire population of the country. To circumvent the challenges with CRVS and RHIS, countries usually implement national household sample surveys. The survey approach has been very beneficial and contributed substantially to advances in health programming and monitoring. However, surveys are irregular, short-term, and do not produce the recent data and disaggregation needed by these countries, specifically for outcomes such as mortality and health status. While they are effective at addressing specific health questions in specific populations and must continue and be improved on, they are not the most effective at continuous mortality monitoring. A sample registration system (SRS) uses a similar sampling survey concept but establishes continuous collection of population, fertility and mortality data from small geographic areas, carefully selected to generate estimates that are representative at a desired domain such as national, provincial or district. An SRS does not register events legally, nor does it aim to cover the entire population. It is a vital statistics approach that collects and analyzes mortality and other population data to generate regular empirical estimates that are used for health monitoring. It can however facilitate registration of events within its coverage areas by linking to a CRVS system where events identified are transferred and registered. It can help catalyze the rapid scale-up of the CRVS system by not only linking the data but evaluating the completeness and quality of information from the CRVS system. Strategies that would build on an SRS to improve the completeness of CRVS are yet to be demonstrated. SRS have been implemented in many countries, including India1, Bangladesh2, Indonesia3, Vietnam4, and China5. The experience in Africa is limited to one trial in Tanzania6 and recent launches in Mozambique and Sierra Leone.7,8 Recognizing the essential need for African countries to establish and strengthen systems to monitor mortality, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) developed, through consultation with its member States and experts, a continental framework for strengthening mortality surveillance in Africa, launched in September 2022.9 The framework represents an initial overall guidance document for countries in developing a strong mortality surveillance system that is based on a well-coordinated and integrated approach and aimed to harmonize all existing mortality data systems, standardize existing processes for data collection, analysis and dissemination, and standardizing mechanisms for death reporting that is aligned with the CRVS. Countries will still need practical manuals on the implementation of specific surveillance approaches. These operational manuals are under development by Africa CDC. Building on this momentum, the World Health Organization has also initiated the development of guidance materials for integrated mortality surveillance. While these efforts are critically needed to fill the mortality monitoring literacy gaps in LMICs, concrete steps toward systems that can generate reliable data in the short run are yet to be widely published. Located in Eastern African, Mozambique launched an SRS in 2017 with financial support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and technical assistance from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The SRS was initially implemented jointly by the National Institute of Health (INS) and the National Institute of Statistics (INE), but transitioned to INS leadership since 2021, with financial support from the Global Fund. It was initially called “Countrywide Mortality Surveillance for Action – COMSA” and later rebranded as “Sistema Comunitário de Vigilância em Saúde e de Eventos Vitais (Sis-COVE)” (Community Surveillance System for health and Vital Events). A similar investment was also implemented in Sierra Leone, in West Africa, since 2018 with technical assistance from the University of Toronto and implemented locally by the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Njala University.viii This manual describes key steps and resources needed for the implementation of an SRS by an LMIC, building on the experience from Mozambique. It is developed as a practical resource with step-by-step guidance for countries and institutions interested in implementing an SRS for mortality surveillance. Supplementary materials are developed and made available to support each step. These materials are provided are samples or templates for adaptation and customization based on the country context and the objectives of the SRS. The manual is based on twelve key steps for building and making functional an SRS, going from the initial conception to the full implementation and dissemination of the results. These twelve steps are organized within seven key phases that define the life-cycle of an SRS system. http://censusindia.gov.in/vital_statistics/SRS/Sample_Registration_System.aspx↩︎ Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS).

SRS is a sustained continuous rigorous data collection and analysis approach that relies on a sample of the population organized in geographic clusters and drawn to be nationally and sub-nationally representative with the aim of producing population empirical estimates of mortality and cause of death and other population demographics. The name SRS can be misleading as the system does not aim to legally register events births and identify deaths. Its main purpose is to generate data for statistics, as opposed to a CRVS which is mandated for legal registration and official documentation of vital events. By design, an SRS does not exhaustively cover the entire population of a country but collects data from only a small fraction (1-5% depending on total population size) to make inferences on the entire population. Depending on resources and country needs, the population covered can be selected in such a way that population indicators measured are representative at specified statistical domains, which can be national, regional/provincial, or district-level. Thus, an SRS is a sample vital statistics system, often limited to most relevant vital events such as births, deaths, and population counts. Given the centrality of collecting mortality data, we will refer to it as a Sample-based Mortality Surveillance System (SMSS). Throughout the manual, we refer to SRS as SMSS. Defining mortality surveillance A SMSS involves: Continuous near real-time data collection on births, deaths, and causes of death, consistently with existing global or national standards. Ideally, updated population counts by age and sex. Geographically contained and sample-based estimates, whether national or subnational, with population representativeness Data analysis to produce reliable and interpretable estimates of all-causes and cause-specific mortality with relevant disaggregation (by age, sex, and other selected characteristics). Regular data release for use in policy and program decision-making, learning, and research. Overview of How to Create an SMSS Designing and successfully implementing an SMSS is a longterm commitment that must be guided by a government vision of establishing a sustainable surveillance system for rapid mortality and cause of death data generation and use. Such systems must be guided by six main principles that ensure that consideration and value is given to the existing data system through possible linkages or integration, key stakeholders and players at the country level are engaged, and progress and priority toward full functioning of civil registration and vital statistics is not diminished. The box below summarizes these six guiding principles. Countries or users may define additional principles depending on their specific context and objectives of the surveillance system being pursued. Six Guiding Principles for Establishing a Mortality Surveillance System The collection of mortality statistics is complex and requires the involvment of multiple sectors and stakeholders that are interested in these statistics. Many countries are already implementing various surveillance systems that are at different levels of maturity. The proposed surveillance system must leverage and build on existing country digital tools and surveillance systems rather than creating a completely new and parallel system. New platforms may be proposed to support additional data collection, in order to enhance or fill gaps in existing platforms, but they must incorporate linkages and interoperability with key existing government systems. The proposed mortality surveillance system must value, support, and strengthen the country’s vision for establishing a long-term CVRS. The proposed system has a data production function solely and does not seek to interfere with the legal framework of CRVS or the service delivery function of other existing systems, although it may support the optimal functionality of these systems regarding these objectives. More concretely, the development of an SMSS requires twelve key steps which are presented on the following page. These four phases are continuous throughout the life of the SMSS. These are enumerated below and constitute the common thread and outline of this manual. Each step is further detailed in each section of the manual. Taking a big picture view, the steps that can be organized in six distinct phases that we refer to as the lifecycle of an SMSS. These six phases are divided into two components. The start-up component includes the phases of conception, planning, and launch which are completed when the system is first established. The recurrent components include: routine data collection and transfer; data review, analysis, integration and use; and assessment, adjustment, and sustainability. As shown in the diagram below, the timing of the individual steps can overlap. Although the duration of each step will vary according to the context, the approximate duration is presented below.

<p><em>This section explains why sample registration systems are needed in
low- and middle-income countries and how we are using the term
sample-based mortality surveillance system throughout this document. It
also gives an overview of the steps required for implementing an SMSS.</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A sample registration system (SRS) uses a similar sampling survey
concept but establishes continuous collection of population,
fertility and mortality data from small geographic areas, carefully
selected to generate estimates that are representative at a desired
domain such as national, provincial or district level.</p></li>
<li><p>An SRS can provide data that’s more complete than the data from
civil registration and health systems and more timely than data from
largescale household surveys.</p></li>
<li><p>An SRS can be designed to catalyze the rapid scale-up of Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics in high mortality countries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The availability of continuous information on mortality and its
distribution in a country is necessary for effective decision-making in
health program planning and resource allocation. It is also required for
the monitoring of the effectiveness of health programs in preventing
premature deaths. However, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
which bear the highest burden of preventable premature deaths, suffer a
crucial lack of timely data on mortality and causes of death. Thus, they
are unable to adequately make health planning decisions based on local
and empirical mortality information.</p>
<p>Government data systems such as the civil registration and vital
statistics (CRVS) and the routine health information system (RHIS) offer
promising solutions, but their current mortality deficiencies are
enormous and structural, and it will take decades to address them. CRVS
suffers severe coverage and event registration incompleteness. RHIS
captures only facility users, and deaths are not completely recorded and
reported or always certified with cause of death. A feature of these
systems, which is also their main challenge, is their exhaustivity
mandate, that is their legal and ethical requirement to cover the entire
population of the country.</p>
<p>To circumvent the challenges with CRVS and RHIS, countries usually
implement national household sample surveys. The survey approach has
been very beneficial and contributed substantially to advances in health
programming and monitoring. However, surveys are irregular, short-term,
and do not produce the recent data and disaggregation needed by these
countries, specifically for outcomes such as mortality and health
status. While they are effective at addressing specific health questions
in specific populations and must continue and be improved on, they are
not the most effective at continuous mortality monitoring.</p>
<p>A sample registration system (SRS) uses a similar sampling survey
concept but establishes continuous collection of population, fertility
and mortality data from small geographic areas, carefully selected to
generate estimates that are representative at a desired domain such as
national, provincial or district. An SRS does not register events
legally, nor does it aim to cover the entire population. It is a vital
statistics approach that collects and analyzes mortality and other
population data to generate regular empirical estimates that are used
for health monitoring. It can however facilitate registration of events
within its coverage areas by linking to a CRVS system where events
identified are transferred and registered. It can help catalyze the
rapid scale-up of the CRVS system by not only linking the data but
evaluating the completeness and quality of information from the CRVS
system. Strategies that would build on an SRS to improve the
completeness of CRVS are yet to be demonstrated. SRS have been
implemented in many countries, including India<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, Bangladesh<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
Indonesia<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, Vietnam<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, and China<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. The experience in Africa is
limited to one trial in Tanzania<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and recent launches in Mozambique
and Sierra Leone.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Recognizing the essential need for African countries to establish and
strengthen systems to monitor mortality, the Africa Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) developed, through consultation with
its member States and experts, a continental framework for strengthening
mortality surveillance in Africa, launched in September 2022.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The
framework represents an initial overall guidance document for countries
in developing a strong mortality surveillance system that is based on a
well-coordinated and integrated approach and aimed to harmonize all
existing mortality data systems, standardize existing processes for data
collection, analysis and dissemination, and standardizing mechanisms for
death reporting that is aligned with the CRVS. Countries will still need
practical manuals on the implementation of specific surveillance
approaches. These operational manuals are under development by Africa
CDC. Building on this momentum, the World Health Organization has also
initiated the development of guidance materials for integrated mortality
surveillance. While these efforts are critically needed to fill the
mortality monitoring literacy gaps in LMICs, concrete steps toward
systems that can generate reliable data in the short run are yet to be
widely published.</p>
<p>Located in Eastern African, Mozambique launched an SRS in 2017 with
financial support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and
technical assistance from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health. The SRS was initially implemented jointly by the National
Institute of Health (INS) and the National Institute of Statistics
(INE), but transitioned to INS leadership since 2021, with financial
support from the Global Fund. It was initially called “<em>Countrywide
Mortality Surveillance for Action – COMSA</em>” and later rebranded as
<em>“Sistema Comunitário de Vigilância em Saúde e de Eventos Vitais
(Sis-COVE)” (Community Surveillance System for health and Vital
Events)</em>. A similar investment was also implemented in Sierra Leone, in
West Africa, since 2018 with technical assistance from the University of
Toronto and implemented locally by the Ministry of Health, in
collaboration with the Njala University.<sup>viii</sup></p>
<p>This manual describes key steps and resources needed for the
implementation of an SRS by an LMIC, building on the experience from
Mozambique. It is developed as a practical resource with step-by-step
guidance for countries and institutions interested in implementing an
SRS for mortality surveillance. Supplementary materials are developed
and made available to support each step. These materials are provided
are samples or templates for adaptation and customization based on the
country context and the objectives of the SRS.</p>
<p>The manual is based on twelve key steps for building and making
functional an SRS, going from the initial conception to the full
implementation and dissemination of the results. These twelve steps are
organized within seven key phases that define the life-cycle of an SRS
system.</p>

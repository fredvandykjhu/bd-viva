<p>Setel and colleagues defined a SRS as “a community-based system
implemented in a nationally representative cluster sample”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. SRS is
a sustained continuous rigorous data collection and analysis approach
that relies on a sample of the population organized in geographic
clusters and drawn to be nationally and sub-nationally representative
with the aim of producing population empirical estimates of mortality
and cause of death and other population demographics. The name SRS can
be misleading as the system does not aim to legally register events
births and identify deaths. Its main purpose is to generate data for
statistics, as opposed to a CRVS which is mandated for legal
registration and official documentation of vital events. By design, an
SRS does not exhaustively cover the entire population of a country but
collects data from only a small fraction (1-5% depending on total
population size) to make inferences on the entire population. Depending
on resources and country needs, the population covered can be selected
in such a way that population indicators measured are representative at
specified statistical domains, which can be national,
regional/provincial, or district-level. Thus, an SRS is a sample vital
statistics system, often limited to most relevant vital events such as
births, deaths, and population counts. Given the centrality of
collecting mortality data, we will refer to it as a Sample-based
Mortality Surveillance System (SMSS). Throughout the manual, we refer to
SRS as SMSS.</p>

<p>Overview of How to Create an SMSS</p>
<p>Designing and successfully implementing an SMSS is a longterm commitment
that must be guided by a government vision of establishing a sustainable
surveillance system for rapid mortality and cause of death data
generation and use. Such systems must be guided by six main principles
that ensure that consideration and value is given to the existing data
system through possible linkages or integration, key stakeholders and
players at the country level are engaged, and progress and priority
toward full functioning of civil registration and vital statistics is
not diminished. The box below summarizes these six guiding principles.
Countries or users may define additional principles depending on their
specific context and objectives of the surveillance system being
pursued.</p>

systems that are at different levels of maturity.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed surveillance system must leverage and build on
existing country digital tools and surveillance systems rather
than creating a completely new and parallel system.</p></li>
<li><p>New platforms may be proposed to support additional data
collection, in order to enhance or fill gaps in existing
platforms, but they must incorporate linkages and
interoperability with key existing government systems.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed mortality surveillance system must value, support,
and strengthen the country’s vision for establishing a long-term
CVRS.</p></li>
<li><p>The proposed system has a data production function solely and
does not seek to interfere with the legal framework of CRVS or
the service delivery function of other existing systems, although
it may support the optimal functionality of these systems
regarding these objectives.</p></li>

<p>More concretely, the development of an SMSS requires twelve key steps
which are presented on the following page. These four phases are
continuous throughout the life of the SMSS. These are enumerated below
and constitute the common thread and outline of this manual. Each step
is further detailed in each section of the manual.</p>
<p><img src="media/image2.svg" style="width:6.5in;height:8.41181in" /></p>
<p>Taking a big picture view, the steps that can be organized in six
distinct phases that we refer to as the lifecycle of an SMSS. These six
phases are divided into two components. The start-up component includes
the phases of conception, planning, and launch which are completed when
the system is first established. The recurrent components include:
routine data collection and transfer; data review, analysis, integration
and use; and assessment, adjustment, and sustainability.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.svg" style="width:6.49792in;height:8.40972in" /></p>
<p>As shown in the diagram below, the timing of the individual steps can
overlap. Although the duration of each step will vary according to the
context, the approximate duration is presented below.</p>
